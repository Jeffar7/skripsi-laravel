	So later that night, he started to brew the Ultimate Coffee again, and now with the added spices. The process was tough and tedious, but nevertheless, he did it.

	The first sip was tasteless with a hint of nutty aftertaste. Suddenly a burst of taste came into his mouth, and then throat, and then- Stomache.

	All of a sudden, he realized that he is half skeleton now. But, he felt his sense of taste quadrupled. Without bothering his looks now, he rushed to his younglings and told them to drink the Ultimate Coffee.
