	Our lil’ take on doing selvedge denim mask. Made using 12 oz./ sq. yard locally sourced rope dyed selvedge denim. Lined with breathable herringbone twill fabric. Has gone thru initial cleaning & soaking process using antiseptic liquid. Another self-soak / wash process prior to wear is of course recommended.

	This version came with longer elastic earloop, simply tie it to your preferred sizing.
