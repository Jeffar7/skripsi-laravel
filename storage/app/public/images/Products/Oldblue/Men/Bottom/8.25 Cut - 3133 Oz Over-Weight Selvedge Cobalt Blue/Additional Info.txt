Description: The first above 30 oz. denim we’ve ever used.
	The first (and might be the last) milled in China denim we’ve ever used.
	The first royal blue and red wine weft denim we’ve ever used.
	The first above 30 oz. denim in particular dyed weft that you’ve might ever seen.
	The #9THRUNNINWILD special denim collection.

	31/33 ounces beyond heavy indigo denim. Unsanforized loom-state denim. Exclusively-milled in China. Colored (Red Wine and Royal Blue) reactive dyed weft. Loomed using insanely thick yarns. 3 plied of 5S yarns for both of its warp & weft (5S/3 * 5S/3). The yarns originated from the Extra-Long-Staple cotton, from Urumqi, Xinjiang, where there is a long time of sunshine, so the cotton quality is, of course, better.

	Each denim is available on both of our 8.25? and 7.75? Cut. Filled with many special details, such as, (the first ever) hidden looped arcuate, (the first ever) back pocket embroidery, (the first ever) special full-printed pocket bag fabric, (the first ever) black horizontal tab on coin pocket, and extra thick 4.0-4.5 cow hide with debossed-print technique.
