Description: Survive,evolve,inherited.The new loom collection silhouette inspired from a bowling shoes which are popular in the late 18th century,also familiar as an industrial revolution time. A time when machine started to replace all the beauty of handmade. As much as we embrace the tech revolution,we must also appreciate the past where we inherited, so we combined those two things as we used century old hand-woven looming technique in a bowling shoes silhoutte upper with our signature L.I.F.E tech on the outsole.
